# E-Commerce Website

Welcome to our E-Commerce Website! This website offers a wide range of mobile phones, tablets, earbuds, and smartwatches for purchase. Below are some important details about the website:

## Features

### Responsive Design
The website is designed to provide an optimal viewing experience across various devices and screen sizes. It adapts seamlessly to desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones, ensuring a user-friendly interface for all visitors.

### Dynamic Product Catalog
The product catalog dynamically displays available products and their details, such as name, price, description, rating, and reviews. This allows customers to browse and evaluate products before making a purchase decision.

### Shopping Cart
Our website includes a shopping cart feature that enables users to add, remove, and update the products they wish to buy. The cart keeps track of the selected items, their quantities, and calculates the total price.

### Checkout Process
We have implemented a checkout process that ensures the validity of user inputs and securely collects order information. The checkout process involves validating user details, shipping address, and payment information. SQL queries are used to store the order information securely in the database.

### Confirmation Page
Once the order is successfully placed, customers are redirected to a confirmation page. This page provides a summary of the order, including the purchased items, total price, and other relevant details. Additionally, it displays a thank you message to express gratitude for the purchase.

## Files

The website consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file that structures the content of the website.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that defines the visual styling and layout of the website.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file responsible for the website's functionality and interactivity.
- `products.json`: A JSON file that stores the product data in an array of objects.
- `db.sql`: An SQL file that contains the necessary SQL queries to create and populate the database table for storing order information.

## Local Setup

To run the website locally, follow these steps:

1. Install a web server software like XAMPP or WAMP on your computer.
2. Import the `db.sql` file into your database server using a tool like phpMyAdmin.
3. Place the website files in the appropriate directory of your web server (e.g., the `htdocs` folder in XAMPP).
4. Start your web server and ensure it is running.
5. Open your web browser and enter the local URL of the website (e.g., `http://localhost/ecommerce-website/index.html`).

You should now be able to access and explore the E-Commerce website on your local machine.
